 Tatsumi response: Hi Martin! I've never played fall guys yet but I really interested in to play fall guys! Your website responsive design is so good!  Also I like your contents of website that fall guys introduction and rule is very easy to understand and briefly. 

Suggestions:

I'm a not designer but your website background color is hard to read sentences, so I feel other color might be easy to read sentences.  

If you add some images to your website, I think your website seems like more cool. And it is difficult to imagine to what is fall guys and what's kind of game.

In addition, it is might better to add navigation bar to example of mini games.

Tasiumi advice (fix): change: clolor background to improve readability, added image to read


Jovani response: I like the websites use of color to divide the different sections and how you use the bullets lists. I think this website would benefit form using different background colors in the different sections to help divide them more and add readability.
