Pokimane is a well known Streamer both on twitch and youtube. She is one of the most popular streamers (on twitch) and a
few years ago got Best Streamers award in 2017 for her high viwership along the years.
She plays various different games like Valorant, Overwatch, FALL GUYS, etc. I reccomend tuning into here streams because
she is a well respected person on both platforms
and ofcourse if you want to learn how to play Fall Guys she is a person that plays the game from time to time.
